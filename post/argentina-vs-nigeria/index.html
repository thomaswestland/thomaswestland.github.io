      <p>On paper, federations generally seem like a good idea. A federal state
can pool the resources of what would otherwise be separate economies to
provide public goods more efficiently, which is what states are there
for, at least from an economist’s perspective. Public goods, to expand
Samuelson’s 1954 definition a little bit,<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> are those which can be
enjoyed in common, either because they can be consumed by each
individual without detracting from anyone else’s consumption (e.g.
national defence or clean air), or because one individual’s consumption
of them makes everyone else better off through positive externalities,
even if not everyone can consume that good or use that service at the
same time (e.g. highways or public, free-at-the-point-of-access
healthcare).<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>A federal state is efficient at providing those public goods because it benefits from economies of scale, as fixed and initial costs to set up the bureaucracy and infrastructure needed can be very
high and so the marginal cost of expanding the provision tends to
decrease with scale (think about the cost of creating a judicial system,
and how adding every additional judge afterwards is cheaper once you
have the system up and running). Large federal states (NB: not big
federal governments necessarily!) also appeal to economists because they
provide the legal and political framework for market integration:
without internal tariffs for commodities or restrictions to the movement
of factors, the allocation of capital and labour should be more
efficient, encouraging specialization in the comparative advantage of
each province (because, as Adam Smith said and Brexit will perhaps prove
once again, the extent of the division of labour is limited by market
size).</p>

<p>Federations are also machines of spatial redistribution. They
redistribute fiscal resources generated in one province<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> either
individually to another province (via federal subsidies or transfers) or
to all of them (when using those resources to support federal-level
public goods, as in defence or monetary policy, from which the rich
provinces get less utility relative to the share they’ve paid for).
Federations redistribute policy responsibility spatially as well, when
they decide which level of government should organize the provision of
the public goods in question.</p>

<p>The problem with federations, then, is that sharing is difficult, as
most kids learn early on (and a particularly difficult lesson that is
when, like me, they don’t have siblings). By sharing I mean really
sharing—economic solidarity as opposed to charity: giving a
non-negligible part of your income, enough to make you less well-off
significantly, to someone poorer. When I was a kid for some reason the
inner joy brought about by the warm glow of giving wasn&rsquo;t enticing
enough: if, through no fault of my own, I happened to get better gifts
than my cousin, then why should I compromise and lend him my shiny new
Batmobile for a whole weekend? To put in terms of today’s World Cup
match: if you’re 1900s Buenos Aires and happen to have the best seaport
in the country and a very productive export agriculture, why should you
not be allowed to keep most of Argentina’s tariff revenue? And if oil
reserves are concentrated in the Niger delta, why should the majority of
oil revenue be spent elsewhere in Nigeria? Also, many economists would
say, making very productive regions pay disproportionally (via increased
taxes) for the costs of a federation could distort incentives to invest
in them, thereby affecting the regional engines of national economic
growth.</p>

<p><em>Belle époque</em> Argentina (c. 1870-1913) and post-civil war Nigeria
(since 1970) faced these problems, compounded by challenging population
geographies. By 1869, half of the Argentine population lived far from
the littoral areas, where most of the capacity for raising public
revenue was concentrated. Buenos Aires and Entre Ríos had been home for
decades to an extremely productive livestock export economy, and Santa
Fe became the centre of a rapidly growing grain agriculture, which would
eventually make Argentina the world&rsquo;s largest exporter of corn and
linseed, and one of the three largest wheat producers in the world. The
inner provinces, in the west (the region known as Cuyo) and the north,
were largely disconnected from the agricultural export-led boom, but
they were home to comparatively large populations, which reflected the
preceding history of the River Plate in the colonial period, when the
gravitational pull of the economy came from the Potosí mines to the
north-west (already by 1809 more than half of the &lsquo;Argentine&rsquo; population
was in the north). Looking at this pattern, and comparing it to
Australia&rsquo;s population geography concentrated in the most productive
states (New South Wales and Victoria), Gerchunoff and Torre have argued
that the Argentine population was in the wrong place.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> Until 1890,
each provincial government was responsible for raising its own taxes,
whilst the federal government kept all the tariff revenue. The classic
problem of instability of fiscal revenue based on taxing foreign trade
led the federal government to create some new internal taxes,
superimposed on provincial ones, but tariffs still accounted for three
quarters of revenues to the federal coffers, and fiscal federalism
remained very limited. Inflows of capital and labour (in the form of
hundreds of thousands of mostly southern Europeans) were therefore
concentrated in Buenos Aires (both the city and the surrounding
province), which became home to almost half of Argentina&rsquo;s population by
1914, whereas the west and north&rsquo;s combined share dropped to under 30%.</p>

<p>In 1970s Nigeria, the demographically largest regions were
geographically, and to a large extent, ethnically separated from the
comparatively more sparsely populated delta states which held the oil
reserves ultimately responsible for more than 80% of national fiscal
revenue. Until 1970, fiscal federalism in Nigeria had been limited by
the derivation principle established during British rule as early as
1946, under which allocation of fiscal resources benefited almost solely
the region where revenue was generated, which greatly benefitted the
south-west in the 1950s during its cocoa export boom. Derivation was
progressively abandoned in favour of the Distributable Pool Account
(DPA) as the allocation principle over the late 1960s, and once the
(perhaps related?) civil war was over in 1970, the military regime
reduced the share of allocation based on derivation to 50%, which meant
that half of the oil-fuelled DPA was allocated to states on the bases of
their population.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:5"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> In 1971, the federal government itself started
collecting oil receipts, of which only 20% were devolved to the
oil-producing states. During the oil boom the mid-west Niger delta was
still the region with more fiscal expenditure per capita, but its share
was almost eight times smaller than it would have been under the
derivation principle. Furthermore, as Olowononi argued, the fact that
states depended so significantly on oil revenues which reached them only
through the federally administered DPA weakened federalism in a deeper
sense, creating a fiscal landscape more resembling a unitary system.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:6"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s add just a few numbers to the comparison. If we divide each
country intro four large regions, and define a very simple per capita
fiscal share indicator, dividing each region&rsquo;s share of total national
fiscal expenditure over that region&rsquo;s share of total national
population, Nigeria&rsquo;s 1970s fiscal federalism seems to have been much
stronger than 1910s Argentina&rsquo;s, as all major regions had at least 90%
of the fiscal revenue that would correspond to them on the basis of
their population sizes (which is the single best indicator of the scale
of the public goods they had to provide). Argentina&rsquo;s north, on the
other hand, got only about two-thirds of what it would have received on
a per capita basis.</p>

<p>Economies are also polities, and sharing tends to be good politics:
Argentina and Nigeria both endured civil war after their independence,
and in both cases many contemporary observers doubted that these federal
countries would remain united as such. An imperfect but still
consequential fiscal federalism possibly played a part in that. But
sharing can also be good economics. First, it can be an effective
antidote to the changing fortunes of economic cycles: provinces which
once were net recipients of federal monies can later on become net
contributors (such as Western Australia after the mining boom). Second,
and more importantly, since economic development is ultimately about
improving people&rsquo;s material welfare, the strongest economic argument for
intra-federal fiscal transfers is that they have the potential to create
greatest happiness for the greatest number, even if they are not
Pareto-efficient. The decision to share or not to share fiscal resources
and economic prosperity also translates into population geography: if
people can&rsquo;t get richer where they are, they will try to go to a place
where they can.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:7"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> When fiscal federalism suffers, either by policy
choice or because the fiscal muscle for intra-federation transfers is
not as strong, large-scale internal migration often occurs. In 1930s
Argentina, when the agricultural export economy stagnated in the 1930s
and imports (and therefore the tariffs providing most of the fiscal
revenue) contracted further crippling the already very limited fiscal
federalism, hundreds of thousands of internal migrants moved towards the
capital, creating the greater Buenos Aires as we now know it. In so
doing the also gave Peronism a social base, but that is a topic for
another matchday.</p>
