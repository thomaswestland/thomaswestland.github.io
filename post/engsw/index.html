    <div class="content">
      <p>How much should workers get paid in a country going through (or aspiring
to) broad-based economic growth? the economist asks. She quickly
explains her use of <em>should</em> refers to an equilibrium solution rather
than a moral sense of ideal, but her historian friend is still not
convinced. What is relevant, the historian says, is why in some places
and times in the past workers got a larger slice of the cake than in
others. The economist scoffs at this: income distribution is not
analogous to splitting one single cake. Economic growth can produce
Pareto-efficient outcomes: if as a worker eat more cake than before you
should be happy, regardless of how much more cake than you capitalists
get. And yet, the historian replies, people sometimes aren&rsquo;t happy with
that outcome—they care about relative slice sizes even if you can show
them that there is more cake in the oven. The standards of material
welfare of most workers improved in post-war England and Sweden, and
quite impressively so. But Swedish workers were distributionally better
off than England&rsquo;s, as their wages grew faster than their employers&rsquo;
profits. Why did workers in post-war Sweden get a larger share of the
new cakes of the golden age of western capitalism than their English
counterparts? And why, if at all, does this matter?</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t primarily about the general rules of the game in the labour
market, as in both post-war England and Sweden widespread collective
bargaining ensured high levels of non-market coordination in industrial
relations. There wasn&rsquo;t a policy gulf either, at least at first: Sweden
became well-known internationally for its large and generous welfare
state, but government spending in health, education, and pensions was
also rapidly expanding in post-war Britain. Here, social security
spending grew at a mean annual rate of 4.5 per cent between 1949 and
1996, outpacing average income growth by 50%. At 2.4 per annum, the
growth in real disposable incomes was impressive itself: the mean Briton
in the late 1990s was almost three times better off than fifty years
before. So there was definitely more cake in the oven and there was an
increase in public spending to try and guarantee that everyone got at
least a slice. Yet inequality in Britain increased over the second half
of the twentieth century, particularly over the 1980s when the number of
people earning half the national average increasing from 5 million to
13.5 million.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Despite some common goals in terms of policy shared by the likes of
Clement Attlee and Tage Erlander, the historical starting point was very
different with regards to the functional distribution of income.
<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03585522.2014.932837?needAccess=true">Bengtsson has
shown</a>
that the Swedish labour share had surged already in the 1920s, well
before collective bargaining and the onset of the Nordic welfare state,
as a result mainly of low unemployment rates and high trade union
density. Granted, and as Piketty argued for the advanced economies as a
whole, the losses of the top income earners in twentieth-century Sweden
were not the gains of the poorest Swedes, but of a &lsquo;patrimonial middle
class&rsquo;, of which many unionized industrial workers became a part. The
political power wielded by unions also affected the specifics of
collective bargaining, particularly the level at which wages and
industrial relations were negotiated. To put it briefly, in the UK it
was always closer to the plant-level, or at best at the industry level,
whereas the Swedish model relied on central wage-setting, often with
effective sanctions for employers who failed to comply (see <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/4541">Golden et
al&rsquo;s comparative
study</a>).</p>

<p>Inequality between capital and labour (and within wage-earners as well)
was, then, already much lower in Sweden than in Britain (and anywhere
else for where we have data, according to <a href="https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0047272707001041/1-s2.0-S0047272707001041-main.pdf?_tid=ca5b8c41-fa62-485b-a98f-1aecde198220&amp;acdnat=1531053381_0dfc09dd1e5e22372061151e5cf10964">Roine and
Waldenström</a>)
by 1950. But during the expansion of the welfare state top incomes in
Sweden continued to decline, which didn&rsquo;t happen in Britain. This is
explained by the comparative intensity of social spending.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> As
Johnson has shown, in the era of expanding social spending in Western
Europe (1960-1975) British public spending in education, health and
pensions expanded at a slower rate than in the other European OECD
economies, and since the 1980s it decreased as a share of GDP far
faster. This gap across the English Channel can also be seen as a lag:
by 1994 Britain was spending 5.4 per cent of its GDP in education, a
figure similar to Sweden&rsquo;s four decades earlier.</p>

<p>Post-war Britain&rsquo;s workers were distributionally worse off than Sweden&rsquo;s
because labour&rsquo;s share in Britain was much lower than in Sweden already
before 1945, and a comparatively shorter and less intense welfare state
expansion was not enough to revert that trend. This matters because
labour&rsquo;s share is a key driver of inequality—the incomes of labour
(wages) are much more evenly distributed than the incomes of capital
(profits)—and the British path of increasing welfare expenditure with
<em>increasing</em> inequality is largely explained by rapidly declining
labour&rsquo;s shares of national income, especially since the mid-1970s,
which were documented in detail by
<a href="https://watermark.silverchair.com/106.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAbgwggG0BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGlMIIBoQIBADCCAZoGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMjqr1X3kGGhJ-CR9JAgEQgIIBa6ulaBAk7T3gKbU3VWuBZLv0vbVSe5geDRqaaEidf_9">Ryan</a>.
Of course, capital played its game as well. The strong comeback of
private capital in the richest countries since the 1970s which Piketty
emphasised is the other side of this coin, and it affected Sweden as
well as Britain. But if the trend was shared, its level wasn&rsquo;t. As a
result, today Britain and Sweden sit at opposite ends of the European
continuum in terms of income inequality, with the top decile&rsquo;s share of
income at 40% and under 30% respectively. Perhaps that is one of the
reasons why a Swedexit isn&rsquo;t in the cards.</p>

incomes, but about lifetime itself: by the late 1990s British male
blue-collar workers lived 7.4 years less than their counterparts in
&ldquo;professional&rdquo; trades (Department of Health, 2002).</p>
